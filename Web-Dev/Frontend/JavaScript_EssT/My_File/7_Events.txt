I. What are DOM elements?
  Everything that happens in the browser is registered as an event

  Trigger specific actions or behaviors when specific interactions occur.

  Event Handling: Building JavaScript functionality around events is called
                  event handling.

                  1. Identify the DOM node the interactive behavior will be
                     attached to.

                     e.g. Call to action button.
                  2. Identify an event you want to occur (on-click) &
                     bind that to the DOM node.

                  3. Create function that is triggered when the event fires.

II. Some typical DOM events

  Browser-level events: Browser behavior
    e.g. Load, window resize, etc.

  DOM-level events: Content interaction
    e.g. Click,focus, submit, etc.

  Reference: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events

  Common Browser-Level events

  * Load - when resource and dependents have finished loading
  * Error - When a resource failed to load
  * Online/offline - self-explanatory
  * Resize - when a viewport is resized
  * Scroll - when a viewport is scrolled up/down/left/right

  Common DOM events

  * Focus - when an element receives focus (clicked, tabbed to)
  * Blur - when an element loses focus (leaving form field)
  * Resets/submit - form-specific Events
  * Mouse events - click, mouseover, drag, drop, etc.

  Other Events:
  * Media events - relate to audio/video playback
  * Progress events - monitor ongoing browser Progress
  * CSS transition events - transition start/run/end



III. Trigger functions with event handlers


IV. Add and use event listeners

  Event Listeners: listens for an event to occur and passes event to
  specified function.


V. Pas arguments via event listeners


Quiz:

Include event "onclick" in a button that displays time:
<html>
<body>
  <button onclick="this.innerHTML=Date()">The time is = </button>
</body>
</html>

Event handlers (element.event = function()) you cannot trigger several
different functions uing a single event
