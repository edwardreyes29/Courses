I. What is JavaScript?
    Webpage consists of three layers of code put
    together by the browser:
        1. HTML Markup: Content Layer
            - Content lives
            - Mark up language makes it easy for browser to parse
        2. CSS Rules: Content Layer 
            - Code that instructs browser to how to display HTML Markup
            - HTML handles content and CSS handles presentation
            - Works as a presentational enhancement
        3. JavaScript: Interactive layers
            - Scripting language that urns in browser and interacts with HTML Markup
                and CSS Rules to change what you see and what you can do.

II. Navigating JavaScript landscape
    - ES6 -> ECMAScript 2015 
    - Browsers use ECMAScript to interpret JavaScript.

   

    jQuery: - Library of JavaScript functions
            - Introduces CSS-like syntax and several visual and UI enhancements
            - Simplifies the use of JavaScript in websites
            - An abstraction of core language
    JavaScript Frameworks:
        - AngularJS, React, Vue.js, and so on are front-end application Frameworks
        used to simplify the building of advanced interactive web-based applications.

        Facebook -> React
        - Traditionally, technologies like php generate pages on server and send them to browser whereas these
          frameworks run in the browser and pull just data from the server.
        - Makes websites run really fast.

    JavaScript Platforms:
        - Node.js
            - JavaScript platform built on browser runtime environments.
            - Used to run advanced operations and applications on servers and computers using JavaScript
            - Will be used here to debug JavaScript code
