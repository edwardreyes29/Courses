I. Exploring the anchor element

<link> is used to request external resources for a page.
<a> anchor tag -> used for links.

  <a href="seed.html">Planting a Seed</a>
  - makes the inner HTML a clickable
  - href tells web browser where to go once clicked.
    - href: hypertext reference
    - target: whether to open on a new tab.
    - rel: relationship of the target object to the link object
      -(update portfolio)
    - title: for assistive devices. A descriptive text of where this link is
             going to go.

II. Linking to pages within your site


III. Linking to external pages
  - GLUT Links -> external links
  - You need the protocol for absolute link (http/https)

  - target="_blank"
    - to open link to a new tab.


IV. Linking to downloadable resources
  * give user ability to download certain files
  * may need scripting for security purposes.
  * use download attribute.
  * if it runs a file it does not recognize, it usually starts a download.
    - unless if the file ends with something like a .exe where the browser
    - has other security protocols to handle that.
  * zip is something a browser can download,
  * pdf is something a browser can open.
    - to force download on a pdf:
    - give it a download attribute.
      <a href="file.pdf" download>file.pdf</a>

    Ex. <p>Download our <a href="_assets/syntax.pdf"
      title="HTML syntax reference" download>HTML syntax PDF</a> reference!</p>

  * you may have resources created on the fly. Like JS scanning a page and
    creating a pdf and giving it a weird naming convention, you may want to
    force a name on a link that is being downloaded.
    <a href="file.pdf" download="Give name of file here">file.pdf</a>

    Ex. <p>Download our <a href="_assets/syntax.pdf"
      title="HTML syntax reference" download="Sponge_Bob_Square_Pants">HTML syntax PDF</a> reference!</p>


V. Linking to page regions
  * anchors allow us to jump to different sections within a document (fragment identifiers).

  * fragment identifiers jump to the id attribute specified in the link
    <h1 id="top">Using fragment identifiers</h1>
    <p><a href="#one" title="section one">Link to Section 1</a></p>
    <p><a href="#two" title="section two">Link to Section 2</a></p>
    <p><a href="#three" title="section three">Link to Section 3</a></p>

    <h3 id="one">Section 1</h3>
    <h3 id="two">Section 2</h3>
    <h3 id="three">Section 3</h3>

  * Jump down on a page needs ability to jump back up as well
    <p><a href="#top" title="back to the top">Back to top</a></p>


  * Jump to region of another page, without having to deal with the rest of the site.
    Ex. Jump to section two of the destination.htm, by using the sections id.
    <p>Link to <a href="destination.htm#two" title="destination">Section 2</a> of the destination.htm page</p>

  * Jump to another websites section (e.g. w3c table of contents):

    https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/browsers.html#navigating-to-a-fragment-identifier

    #navigating-to-a-fragment-identifier is the id.

    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/browsers.html#navigating-to-a-fragment-identifier"
      title="W3C fragment identifiers">Fragment identifiers</a> as defined by the W3C</p>
