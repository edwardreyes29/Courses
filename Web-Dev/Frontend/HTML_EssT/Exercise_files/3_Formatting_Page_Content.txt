I. Formatting content with html
  <pre> tag:
    - used for snippets
    - respects white space

    Don't rely on presentational tags for styling, use CSS.
    Rely on logic tags. like <em> instead of <i>
    Screen readers will change it's vocal inflection when reading text within
    <em> tags.
    <strong> instead of <b>

II. Using headings
  Use headings appropriately by assigning same level of importance. Ignore
  visual properties.

  Limit use of h1.

  Don't skip a series of headings, e.g. from h2 to and h5.

III. Formatting paragraphs
  html has to be backwards compatible, but it's pretty forgiving, but must
  format completely.

  margins collapse between different tag, so if h1 has 20 margin bottom and
  paragraph has 20 margin top, it doesn't double or stack.

  <p>&nbsp;</p> nonbreaking space character.

IV. Controlling line breaks
  When you need to force a hard return without creating a new element.
  <br>
    - creates a line break
    - no closing tag needed.
    - Doesn't create new section of content.

  <br />
    - self closing tag, needed for XHTML
    - seen for image tags or other tags may use this. But for html5 not needed.

V. Emphasizing Text
  <dl>: definition list

  <b> purely presentational
  <strong> means you're strongly emphasizing text.
  - screen readers.

VI. Displaying special characters
