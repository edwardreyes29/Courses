I. The value structure

  Semantics:
    How to structure documents that illustrate the meaning of the contents

    Assistive technology & search engines doesn't care about website visual layout.
      - Structure of the page has to convey structure of the content (hierarchy)

    Sectioning elements:
      <h1>...<h6>
      <article>
      <aside>
      <nav>
      <section>

    Semantic Elements:
      <header>
      <main>
      <footer>

II. Controlling document outlines
  What type of document outline you want to generate.
  Use semantic elements to describe the outline of the web page.

  current outline:
  1. Untitled Section

  After adding a <h1>:
  1. My Big Blog

  After adding more heading levels:
  1. My Big Blog
    1. Things I like
      1. My favorite books
        1. Fiction
        2. Non-fiction


  End result after adding proper headings:
    1. My Big Blog
      1. Things I like
        1. My favorite books
            1. Fiction
            2. Non-fiction
        2. My favorite movies and shows
            1. Movies
            2. TV Shows
        3. My favorite music
            1. Jazz
            2. Rock
            3. Americana
        4. Spotlight favorite

        HTML -> semantic sectioning to make outlines more meaningful.

    <nav> -> creates new section that is specific to navifation to this site.
    <article>
    <section> -> sections for different category, music, books, etc..
    <aside> -> tells site that this part is not critical but related to other sections.

    1. My Big Blog
      1. Untitled Section (or NAV)
      2. Things I like
        1. My favorite books
            1. Fiction
            2. Non-fiction
        2. My favorite movies and shows
            1. Movies
            2. TV Shows
        3. My favorite music
            1. Jazz
            2. Rock
            3. Americana
        4. Spotlight favorite

III. The nav element
  <nav> contains main navigation functionality for the page.
  W3C: <nav> element represents a seciton of page that links to other pages
      or to other parts within the page: a section with navigation links.

      footer can have links, but using a <footer> is enough


    Ex. Adding nav to links to other web-pages.

    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="intro.htm" title="Introduction to HTML">Introduction to HTML</a></li>
        <li><a href="syntax.htm" title="HTML syntax">HTML syntax</a></li>
        <li><a href="structure.htm" title="Structuring pages">Structuring pages</a></li>
        <li><a href="links.htm" title="Creating links">Creating links</a></li>
        <li><a href="reference.htm" title="HTML Reference">HTML reference</a></li>
        <li><a href="next.htm" title="Next steps">Next steps</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>

    If you have links to other references and not navigating internally in the original site,
    then it doesn't need <nav>


IV. The article element
  <article> represents ac complete/self-contained composition in a document,
  page, application, or site. Like a magazine, newspaper, technical or scholarly article,
  essay, report, or blog/social media post.

  Think of articles that as individual elements that can stand alone.
