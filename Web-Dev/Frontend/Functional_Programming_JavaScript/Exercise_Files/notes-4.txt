4. Callbacks


S.4.1 Chapter Introductions
// Synchronous Operations -> requires file operation must be fully completed before any other code is executed.
    var file = fs.readFileSync('someHugeFile.txt', 'utf8')
    console.log("That took a long time!")

// Callbacks
    someAsyncTask( function(result) {
        console.log("The result was: " + result)
    })

    console.log("I was called right away!")

    A callback is a function that you pass as an arg to an asynchronous function.


S.4.2 Simple Callbacks

// setTimeout -> delays execution of another function
    setTimeout( function() {
        ...
    }, 3000)


S.4.3 Callback with arguments
    someAsyncFunction( function(err, result) {
        ...
    })
