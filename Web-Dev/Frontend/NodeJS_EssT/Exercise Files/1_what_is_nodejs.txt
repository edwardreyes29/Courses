I. Node.js history 
    https://foundation.nodejs.org
    https://github.com/nodejs

II. How it works
    Blocking, thread waiting for file system to finish reading files before anything else.

    Apache is multi-threaded.

    Nodejs it single-threaded
        - Works Asynchronously -> can do more than one thing at a time.
        - No waiting
        - No Blocking -> Non-blocking, event driven I/O
