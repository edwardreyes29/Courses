I. Navbar overview

    Navigation Components:
        * Navs -> parents to all other navigation components
        * Tabs
        * Pills
        * Navbars -> most used
            Navbar Components:
                * Branding 
                * Color schemes 
                * Dropdowns 
                * Form elements

II. Create basic navigation

    Basic Nav Classes:
        * With/without ULs
        * nav
        * nav-item 
        * nav-link

    Nav Link Options:
        * active 
        * disabled

    Nav Styles:
        * nav-pills (button with round edges)
        * nav-tabs

    Nav Alignment
        * justify-content-center
        * justify-content-end (justify contents all the way to the right)
        * nav-fill (want links to take entire width of container)
        * nav-justified (force space between each element to be the same)
        * flex-column

    nav-fill -> allows text to take up more space if it has more text than the rest.

III. Create a navbar 

    Navbar Classes:
        * navbar
        * navbar-expand(-BP)
            BP: sm >576px | md >768px | lg >992px | xl >1200px

    Navbar Colors:
        * bg-COLOR for backgrounds
            COLOR: primary | secondary | success | danger 
                   warning | info | light | dark | white
        * navbar-light
        * nav-dark 

    navbar-nav Options:
         navbar-nav container (where main links will go)
            * nav-item
            * nav-link 
            * active (shows what is the current page)

    Bootstrap is, by design, a mobile first framework, so navbar by default will stack elements on top of
    each other.

IV. Use branding and text 

    Navbar Options:
        * navbar-brand 
        * Link or Headline 
        * Using Images
        * navbar-text 

        Review spacing classes


V. Add a dropdown to navigation 

    A seprarate in component used in menus.

    Requirements: a container.

    Dropdown Setup:
        * dropdown to align 
        * dropdown-toggle on link 
        * data-toggle="dropdown"
        * dropdown-menus 
            * dropdown-item 
            *id & aria attributes (for accessibility)


        aria-expanded="false" -> if drop down first and appears and doesn't have drop down show, set to false?

VI. Add form elements



VII. Control positioning 



VIII. Create collapsible content
