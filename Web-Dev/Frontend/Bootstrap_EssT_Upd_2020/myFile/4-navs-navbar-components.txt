I. Navbar overview

    Navigation Components:
        * Navs -> parents to all other navigation components
        * Tabs
        * Pills
        * Navbars -> most used
            Navbar Components:
                * Branding 
                * Color schemes 
                * Dropdowns 
                * Form elements

II. Create basic navigation

    Basic Nav Classes:
        * With/without ULs
        * nav
        * nav-item 
        * nav-link

    Nav Link Options:
        * active 
        * disabled

    Nav Styles:
        * nav-pills (button with round edges)
        * nav-tabs

    Nav Alignment
        * justify-content-center
        * justify-content-end (justify contents all the way to the right)
        * nav-fill (want links to take entire width of container)
        * nav-justified (force space between each element to be the same)
        * flex-column

    nav-fill -> allows text to take up more space if it has more text than the rest.

III. Create a navbar 

    Navbar Classes:
        * navbar
        * navbar-expand(-BP)
            BP: sm >576px | md >768px | lg >992px | xl >1200px

    Navbar Colors:
        * bg-COLOR for backgrounds
            COLOR: primary | secondary | success | danger 
                   warning | info | light | dark | white
        * navbar-light
        * nav-dark 

    navbar-nav Options:
         navbar-nav container (where main links will go)
            * nav-item
            * nav-link 
            * active (shows what is the current page)

    Bootstrap is, by design, a mobile first framework, so navbar by default will stack elements on top of
    each other.

IV. Use branding and text 

    Navbar Options:
        * navbar-brand 
        * Link or Headline 
        * Using Images
        * navbar-text 

        Review spacing classes


V. Add a dropdown to navigation 

    A seprarate in component used in menus.

    Requirements: a container.

    Dropdown Setup:
        * dropdown to align 
        * dropdown-toggle on link 
        * data-toggle="dropdown"
        * dropdown-menus 
            * dropdown-item 
            *id & aria attributes (for accessibility)


        aria-expanded="false" -> if drop down first and appears and doesn't have drop down show, set to false?

VI. Add form elements

    Form Classes:
        * form-inline class 
        * form-control class for input fields.
        * Spacing as needed


        mr-2 -> margin right 2 units

VII. Control positioning 

    Placement Options:
        * fixed-top
        * fixed-bottom
        * sticky-top -> not fully compatible wil older browsers
        * Spacing as needed

VIII. Create collapsible content

    Navigation should collapse when screen becomes very small.
    Hamburger menu
    Collapsable Content:
        * collapse class -> goes on content that you want to collapse 
        * navbar-collapse 
        * id 

    Toggler Classes
        * navbar-toggler 
        * Other Properties
        * navbar-toggler-icon

    <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button"
      data-toggle="collapse"></button>

      - data-toggle="collapse" tells bootstrap that this is a special element 
        that javascript is going to control.

    <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button"
      data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#myTogglerNav"
      aria-controls="myToggleNav" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation"></button>

      - aria-controls tells screen readers what this is doing and identifying that this
        button controls element we called myTogglerNave
        -aria-label -> what screen readers will actually read

        The navigation bar will move navbar elements to the left. Add ml-auto to to the 
        navbar element to shift them to the left


Quiz:

1. Nav is the parent to all other navigations

2. To force the space between the elements to be the same, you use nav-justified.

3. You use form-control classes for input fields.

4. Sticky-top is currently the least supported feature in browsers. 

5. What is needed to tie together the collapsable content with the item that is going to do the toggling?
   A: ID
