I. What is a command line?

    CLI :: interact with program without a GUI
    - Send typed commands
    - Display text output
    - Shell or interpreter
        - Environment used
        - One of earliest ways to interact with computer
        - Bash: Bourne-again Shell
    
II. How commands are structured
    General Pattern: Command + Option(s) + Arguments
    >>> ls -lh /usr/bin
    >>> sort -u users.txt
    >>> grep -i "needle" haystack

    There will always be a command.
    But there coult be command with option or command with arguements 

    Command:
        - The program you're running.

            ls :: list, shows file in specified directory

    Options: 
        - Tell program how to operate
        - Start w/ dash (-)
        - most offer one or more option

            -l :: shows long listing of files in a directory
            -a :: tells the command to show all the files, not just hidden ones
            -h :: make files sizes human readable

        - Can combine options:
            -l -a -h --> -lah  
        * Options with two dashes (--) cannot be combined

    Arguments:
        - Tell command what thing to operate on
        - usually a file path or set of files or folders


III. Write commands in a shell at the prompt 

    edward@edward-pc :: username@hostname 

    >>> ls 
        Coding  Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Public  Templates  Videos
        
        - shell interprets my command to list the contents of directory
        - Returns output of that command, which in this case is a
            list of files and folders in my current working directory
    >>> ls -l 
        total 36
        drwxr-xr-x 5 edward edward 4096 Jan 18 22:17 Coding
        drwxr-xr-x 2 edward edward 4096 Jan 19 18:39 Desktop
        drwxr-xr-x 2 edward edward 4096 Nov 30 01:32 Documents
        drwxr-xr-x 2 edward edward 4096 Jan 19 18:39 Downloads
        drwxr-xr-x 2 edward edward 4096 Nov 26 23:32 Music
        drwxr-xr-x 2 edward edward 4096 Nov 26 23:32 Pictures
        drwxr-xr-x 2 edward edward 4096 Nov 26 23:32 Public
        drwxr-xr-x 2 edward edward 4096 Nov 26 23:32 Templates
        drwxr-xr-x 2 edward edward 4096 Nov 26 23:32 Videos

        -l means "long listing", which tells progam to show files with more
            detail that just list of names.

        Down arrow :: Scroll previous commands
        Ctrl + R :: Search command history
        Ctrl + C :: Cancel Command

V. Finding help for commands

    Even experienced commandline users don't memorize everything


    Manual Pages:
        * Tips: 
        1. You don't have to memorize everything

            "Never memorize something that you can look up"
            - Albert Einstein 

            "Learn the concept of application and not memorize data"
            - Neel Bhavsar
        2. man :: open manual pages
            e.g.
                >>> man ls
                - will show information about ls command
                - press [h] to show help

            Navigation:
                e :: move down one line
                y :: move up one line
                f :: forward
                b :: backward
        Can also type [command --help] to see a brief description 

        3. apropos :: searches a list of commands and their descriptions 
                      for text you provide as an arguments
            - time consuming
