I. What is the command line?

  Not all software need a GUI, like servers or embedded applications.

  CLI:
    * Command-line interface
    * Send typed commands
    * Display text output
    * Shell or interpreter (environment used)
      * Bash: bourne-again Shell

II. How commands are structured
  General Command Syntax:
    command + option(s) + argument(s)

    EX: ls -lh /usr/bin
    EX: sort -u users.txt
    EX: grep -i "needle" haystack

    * The command is the program you're running.
        (!) There will always be a command
        ls - lists files in a folder

    * Options tell the program how to operate.
        * Changes behavior of the command
        * Start with a dash
        * Usually one letter
        * Most commands offer one or more option(s)

        EX: ls -l /var/log
          * This will show a long listing of the files in a directory

        EX: ls -l -a -h /var/log
          * (-a) Tells command to show all files, not just the hidden ones
          * (-h) Tells command to make file sizes human readable

        -l -a -h: -lah
        (!) options with two dashes cannot be combined the same way.

    * Arguments tell the command what to operate on.
        Usually a file path.

III. Write commands in a shell at the prompt
  Ctrl-Shift-Plus: increases size of screen


IV. Helpful keyboard shortcuts in terminal
  Tab completion:
    * Automatically completes a file or folder name
    * Makes guesses based on the contents of the path

  Ctrl-C (^C):  cancels command
  Ctrl-E (^E): Move to end of line
  Ctrl-A (^A): Move to beginning of a line text
  (^): Caret, shorthand for Ctrl key
  Ctrl-Left arrow: Move left one word
  Ctrl-Right arrow: Move right one word
  Ctrl-U: Crop from cursor to start
  Ctrl-K: Crop from cursor to end
  Ctrl-Y: Past cropped text
  Ctrl-Shift-C: Copy to clipboard
  Ctrl-Shift-V: Paste from clipboard
  Ctrl-R: Search command history

V. Finding help for commands
  * You don't have to memorize everything
  * Only remember basics

  *man: open manual pages
      Built-in documentation for commands

      Syntax: man command
      EX: man ls
      (!) while in manual page, press H for help
        * press F for forward
        * press B for back
        * press Q to exit help/man
  * many commands have a help option, just type --help after command for
    for a brief summary

  *apropos "description of a command":
    Help you look up a command by its description rather than its name
