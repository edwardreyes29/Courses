I. Files, folders, and navigation
  file: Determines file type
    EX: file myfile.txt

  stat: Display ownership, modification information, etc.
    EX: stat myfile.txt

  cd: change the working directory
  pwd: print name of current/working directory

  (!) Directories with spaces in their names will treat it as two
      separate words.

    1. First solution:
      cd 'Exercise Files'/

    2. Second solution: Escape each space character individually
      cd Exercise\ Files

      ls -R: list subdirectories recursively
      - Will list everything in the folder
      - Helpful for searching whole structure of folders

   cd ..: to go back a directory. The two dots represent the parent directory
          of the current directory.

   Ex: [dep/hr/policies] cd ..
       [dep/hr] cd ..
       [dep]

       or

       [dep/hr/policies] cd ../../
       [dep]

    Ex: To do to a different directory two levels up (using a relative path)
      [dep/hr/policies] cd ../../finance/spreadsheets
      [finance/spreadsheets]

    cd -: used to go back to the previously used folder.

    Ex: [edward@edward-pc spreadsheets]$ cd -
        /home/edward/Coding/Courses/Web-Dev/Basics/Linux_Command_Line/Exercise Files/departments/hr/policies
        [edward@edward-pc policies]$ cd -
        /home/edward/Coding/Courses/Web-Dev/Basics/Linux_Command_Line/Exercise Files/departments/finance/spreadsheets


II. A little more about ls
  list contents of a directory

  [edward@edward-pc Exercise Files]$ ls -l
  total 148
  drwxr-xr-x 7 edward edward   4096 Jun 18  2018 departments
  -rwxr-xr-x 1 edward edward    160 Jun 18  2018 dupes.txt
  -rwxr-xr-x 1 edward edward 130340 Jun 18  2018 log.tar.gz
  -rwxr-xr-x 1 edward edward   1474 Jun 18  2018 poems.txt
  -rwxr-xr-x 1 edward edward    129 Jun 18  2018 simple_data.txt
  -rwxr-xr-x 1 edward edward     63 Dec 10  2018 test.sh

  first column:
    * d for directory (folders are generally blue text)
    * l for link
    * - for folder
  next set of columns:
    * show representation of permissions on the file.

  next shows owner:

  then size in bytes (use -h for readability):


III. Create and remove folders

mkdir: crate a directory
  e.g. mkdir new_folder
  e.g. mkdir new_foler/folder_inside_new_folder


  You can create multiple directories with one mkdir command.

  [edward@edward-pc Exercise Files]$ mkdir departments/customerservice/documents departments/customerservice/cases departments/customerservice/awards
  [edward@edward-pc Exercise Files]$ ls -l departments/customerservice/
  total 12
  drwxr-xr-x 2 edward edward 4096 Feb 29 17:24 awards
  drwxr-xr-x 2 edward edward 4096 Feb 29 17:24 cases
  drwxr-xr-x 2 edward edward 4096 Feb 29 17:24 documents

mkdir -p: creates any parent folder needed.

  Ex. In this example, the legal folder does not exist, so it's created using -p
    mkdir -p departments/legal/contracts

rmdir: remove a directory
  - In order to remove a folder, it must be empty.

IV. Copy, move, and delete files and folders
   cp: copy

    cp source dest

    Ex. cp poems.txt poems2.txt

    Can even copy files into a different path.
    Ex. copy simple_data.txt into the destination directory.
      [edward@edward-pc Exercise Files]$ cp simple_data.txt  departments/hr/employee\ info/
      [edward@edward-pc Exercise Files]$ ls departments/hr/employee\ info/
      simple_data.txt

    mv: move files between folder or rename files.

      Ex. move poems2.txt into the marketing directory
        [edward@edward-pc Exercise Files]$ mv poems2.txt  departments/marketing/
        [edward@edward-pc Exercise Files]$ ls departments/marketing/
        poems2.txt

      Ex. rename the poems2.txt to literature.txt
        [edward@edward-pc Exercise Files]$ mv departments/marketing/poems2.txt departments/marketing/literature.txt
        [edward@edward-pc Exercise Files]$ ls -l departments/marketing/
        total 4
        -rwxr-xr-x 1 edward edward 1474 Feb 29 17:41 literature.txt
