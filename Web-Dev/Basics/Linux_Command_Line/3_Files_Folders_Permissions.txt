I. Files, folders, and navigation
  file: Determines file type
    EX: file myfile.txt

  stat: Display ownership, modification information, etc.
    EX: stat myfile.txt

  cd: change the working directory
  pwd: print name of current/working directory

  (!) Directories with spaces in their names will treat it as two
      separate words.

    1. First solution:
      cd 'Exercise Files'/

    2. Second solution: Escape each space character individually
      cd Exercise\ Files

      ls -R: list subdirectories recursively
      - Will list everything in the folder
      - Helpful for searching whole structure of folders

   cd ..: to go back a directory. The two dots represent the parent directory
          of the current directory.

   Ex: [dep/hr/policies] cd ..
       [dep/hr] cd ..
       [dep]

       or

       [dep/hr/policies] cd ../../
       [dep]

    Ex: To do to a different directory two levels up (using a relative path)
      [dep/hr/policies] cd ../../finance/spreadsheets
      [finance/spreadsheets]

    cd -: used to go back to the previously used folder.

    Ex: [edward@edward-pc spreadsheets]$ cd -
        /home/edward/Coding/Courses/Web-Dev/Basics/Linux_Command_Line/Exercise Files/departments/hr/policies
        [edward@edward-pc policies]$ cd -
        /home/edward/Coding/Courses/Web-Dev/Basics/Linux_Command_Line/Exercise Files/departments/finance/spreadsheets


II. A little more about ls
  list contents of a directory

  [edward@edward-pc Exercise Files]$ ls -l
  total 148
  drwxr-xr-x 7 edward edward   4096 Jun 18  2018 departments
  -rwxr-xr-x 1 edward edward    160 Jun 18  2018 dupes.txt
  -rwxr-xr-x 1 edward edward 130340 Jun 18  2018 log.tar.gz
  -rwxr-xr-x 1 edward edward   1474 Jun 18  2018 poems.txt
  -rwxr-xr-x 1 edward edward    129 Jun 18  2018 simple_data.txt
  -rwxr-xr-x 1 edward edward     63 Dec 10  2018 test.sh

  first column:
    * d for directory (folders are generally blue text)
    * l for link
    * - for folder
  next set of columns:
    * show representation of permissions on the file.

  next shows owner:

  then size in bytes (use -h for readability):


III. Create and remove folders


IV. Copy, move, and delete files and folders
