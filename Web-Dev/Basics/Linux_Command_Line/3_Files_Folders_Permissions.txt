 Overview:
            (file) - determine file type
            (stat) - display file or file system status
            (~) - indicates users home folder
            (cd <path>) - change the working directory
            (pwd) - print name of current/ working directory
            (-R, --recursive) - list subdirectories  recursively
            (cd ..) - to move up a directory
            (cd -) - Takes you to previously used folder
            (cd) - by itself takes you back to home folder.
            (ls -lh) - shows list of files with details and also sizes with units
                (-h, --human-readable), with -l and -s, print sizes of 1000 not 1024
            (mkdir) - make directories
            (-p, --parents) - no error if existing, make parent direcotories as needed.
                e.g.
                > mkdir -p departments/legal/contracts

            (?) - one character
            (rm) - remove files or directories
                - can remove files recursively (Be cautious though)



I. Files, folders, and navigation

    Files:  Collections of information
        e.g. photos, documents, source code, databases, etc.
        
        They are the basic unit of data storage in a graphical environment
        
    Finding out about files:

        (file) - determine file type

            > file dupes.txt
            dupes.txt: ASCII text

            Gives insight into whetehr something is an archive, executable, text file,
            or other kind of document. 

        (stat) - display file or file system status
             - Display ownership, modification information, etx.

            > stat myfile.txt
        
            > stat dupes.txt
              Size: 160       	Blocks: 8          IO Block: 4096   regular file
            Device: 802h/2050d	Inode: 13893739    Links: 1
            Access: (0755/-rwxr-xr-x)  Uid: ( 1000/  edward)   Gid: ( 1000/  edward)
            Access: 2020-01-19 21:01:53.588946611 -0800
            Modify: 2020-01-19 21:01:53.588946611 -0800
            Change: 2020-01-19 21:01:53.588946611 -0800
            Birth: 2020-01-19 21:01:53.588946611 -0800

    Organize files into directories (folders)

        (~) - indicates users home folder
        (cd) - change the working directory
        (pwd) - print name of current/ working directory

        "Exercise Files" directory, need to escape special characters, to let know space is part of folder name
        cd Exercise\ Files


    * Looking into departments folder
        (-R, --recursive)
                list subdirectories  recursively

        > ls -R departments
        departments:
            engineering  finance  hr  marketing  sales

            departments/engineering:
            drawings  invoices  materials

            departments/engineering/drawings:

            departments/engineering/invoices:

            departments/engineering/materials:

            ...

        Reccursice options means when ls comes across a folder, it steps inside
        and looks around, listing anything inside the folder. Does the same thing if it comes
        across another folder inside that folder and reports back.

        Helpful way to explore whole strucutre of folders

        > cd departments/hr/policies
        - to move further down departments directory

        (cd ..) - to move up a directory
              - (..) represents the parent directory of the current directory


        * Currently in departments/hr/policies but want to jump to
          departments/finance/spreadsheets, which is in a folder two levels up.

            > cd ../../finance/spreadsheets
            - go two levels up to departments directory, and then go to finance then spreadsheets

        * Paths that only use a frament of the absolute path to a folder are called relative paths.


        > (cd -)
        - Takes you to previously used folder
        - good for switching back between two folders

        > (cd) - by itself
        - takes you back to home folder.

II. A little more about ls

    > ls --color=always
        - colors represent different aspects of the files in the listing.


        drwxr-xr-x 7 edward edward   4096 Jan 19 21:01 departments
        -rwxr-xr-x 1 edward edward    160 Jan 19 21:01 dupes.txt
        -rwxr-xr-x 1 edward edward 130340 Jan 19 21:01 log.tar.gz
        -rwxr-xr-x 1 edward edward   1474 Jan 19 21:01 poems.txt
        -rwxr-xr-x 1 edward edward    129 Jan 19 21:01 simple_data.txt
        -rwxr-xr-x 1 edward edward     63 Jan 19 21:01 test.sh

        first column: 
            - shows whether an item is a folder or directory (d)
            - a link will be shown with an (l)
            - a file will be shown with a dash (-)
                - indicates that attribute is missing or offset.
            - colors: generally, blue text are folders

        next set of columns (e.g. rwxr-xr-x):
            - Show representation of permissions on the file 

        next set show owner of files and group settings.
        then size of files

        > ls -lh
            total 148K
            drwxr-xr-x 7 edward edward 4.0K Jan 19 21:01 departments
            -rwxr-xr-x 1 edward edward  160 Jan 19 21:01 dupes.txt
            -rwxr-xr-x 1 edward edward 128K Jan 19 21:01 log.tar.gz
            -rwxr-xr-x 1 edward edward 1.5K Jan 19 21:01 poems.txt
            -rwxr-xr-x 1 edward edward  129 Jan 19 21:01 simple_data.txt
            -rwxr-xr-x 1 edward edward   63 Jan 19 21:01 test.sh

        - Shows the file size with appropriate units
        
III. Create and remove folders

    (mkdir) - make directories

    Create a new directory
    > mkdir departments/customerservice

    Create multiple directories in customerservice by separating each command with a space:
    > mkdir departments/customerservice/documents mkdir departments/customerservice/cases
      departments/customerservice/awards

    (-p, --parents)
        no error if existing, make parent direcotories as needed.
    
    (rmdir) - remove empty directories
    ** In order to remove a directory, it needs to be an empty

IV. Copy, move, and delete files and folders

    * Experienced command line users prefer the command line for file management
      because its a lot faster than dragging files with mouse

      Command: Copying file
        (cp) - copy files and directories

        e.g. Copy file and create a new one
        > cp poems.txt poems2.txt
        - first file is file copying from, second is copy to
            - Copy SOURCE to DEST or multiple sources in directory

        e.g. Copy file to a new path
        > cp simple_data.txt departments/hr/employee\ info/
        - this will copy file into a new directory

    Command: Moving file
        - move files between folders or to rename files

        (mv) - move (rename) files

        e.g. Move file to another directory
        > mv poems2.txt departments/marketing/
            - will no long appear in original folder

        e.g. Rename a file
        > mv department/marketing/poems2.txt department/marketing/literature.txt

        (..) - Represents parent folder
        (.) - Represents current folder

        ** e.g. Move file to current folder
        > mv departments/marketing/literature.txt .

        Wildcards are characters that stand for patterns

        (*) - any number of characters
        (?) - one character

        e.g. Move all files ending with .txt to another directory
        > mv *.txt department/marketing/

        e.g. Move all files in a directory to current directory
        > mv departments/marketing/* .

    Command: Remove Files
        (rm) - remove files or directories

        e.g. Remove a file
        > rm literature.txt


CAUTION: Deleting files in command line will permanately delete files/directories.
         There are no trashbins in CL

    departments  log.tar.gz  poems3.txt  poems.txt        test.sh
    dupes.txt    new_folder  poems4.txt  simple_data.txt

    e.g. Delete any poems file using (?)
    > rm poems?.txt
    - Deletes files called poems with one chatacter afterwards


    ** rm can act recursively
    - Goes into a structure of folders and walks through it, performing an action
      on each folder before it moves up the tree.

      e.g. Delete customerservice, by recursivley deleting everything inside of it first
      > rm -r department/customerservice/


V. Find files from the command line
