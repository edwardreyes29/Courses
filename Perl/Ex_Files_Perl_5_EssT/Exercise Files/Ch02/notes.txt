2. Quick Start 

    I. About quick start 
        - fundamental programming concepts 
        - not meant to give in-depth knowledge about perl

        
    II. Hello World
        Perl comes from Unix

        (#!) -> shebang -> common Unix technique for for running a script
        This will tell Unix shell interpreter, bash or ksh, how to run the script
        shows path to perl interpreter

        (use) -> keyword which says to use library or to use some particular configuration

        use 5.18.0; # Tells Perl interpreter to use syntax from Perl 5.18.0, even if you're running a higher level of Perl
            -> Allows Perl develpers to continure to add new features to Perl without breaking the code

        !!! To run script in Terminal: perl myprogram.pl

        semicolons acts more like a sepatator, but its best practice to include it to prevent errors

    III. Counting lines in a file

    my $filename = "linesfile.txt";  
    - my keyword, lexically scoped in enclosing block, local variable to this file. 
    - Can use same name in a different scope
    - ($variable) scalar varaibls carries one variable, one value


    Perl supports three different data types: scalar, array, and hash
        - Will automatically convert between these values
        DuckTyping - "if it looks like a duck its a duck"
        - No constants

    @ - makes variable into an array, $ - makes variable into scalar


    IV. Loops and conditionals 

    V. Functions 

    VI. Using peridoc
