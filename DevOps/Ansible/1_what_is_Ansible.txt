What you should know:
- Linux CL


I. Intro
	A Task execution engine.
	Target local computer.
	Targer remote computers.

	Manages fleet of infastructure.

	Ansible at Scale:
		- Execute tasks on multiple machines at the same time
		
	Modes of Operation: Linear

	1. Rolling Deployments
		- Smaller batches in specific order
		- Ease a change into production
		- Minimize impact of a specific service
	2. Run as fast as you can.

	Written in Python.

	- The way humans direct Ansible to accomplish tasks.
	- blends human readibility with machine parsing.

II. Low-cost fleet management

	Lightweight: Ansible control -------> Fleet
	Minimal requirments: Python with few library.
	Agents	
		- Installed on remote hosts
		- Perform automated functions
		- Communication
		- Required preconfiguration
	Agents are not required
	

	1. Communication with target host defaults to SSH:
		- Widely avaiable and trusted communication protocol.
	2. Transports
		- Task instruction and Task code
		- Return Data

	No persistent state engine.
	state discoverd at runtime.

	Ansible only needs:
	1. Inventory: potential targets
	2. State Directives: Sinlge or multiple
	3. Credentials: communications
	

III. Get started with Ansible
	Ansible needs to be explicitly installed on the control machine.
	- The machine that will processing all the task execution directions.
	Requires Python 2.6 or later.

	Windows cannot run as a control machine

	sudo dnf install ansible

	type: which ansible
		available at /usr/bin/ansible

	install python pip, usefule to use multiple version of ansible

	(!) remove: sudo dnf remove ansible

	Make sure you have python-virtualenv installed:
	sudo dnf install python-virtualenv

	GCC compiler:
	sudo dnf install gcc openssl-devel

	create new python virtualenv:
	virtualenv ~/ansible

	Acitvate this env:
	source ~/ansible/bin/activate

	type which pip to verfify:
	which pip
	returns: ~/ansible/bin/pip
	(ansible)

	Search for anisble using pip
	pip search ansible
		- shows many results
	
	pip search ansible |less
		- anything that stars with ansible

	Alternatively< pypi.org, search ansible, and first
	result is package looking for.

	Finally install:
	pip install ansible
		this time no config file set.
