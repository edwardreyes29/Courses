I. What is SQL?
  Structured Query Language
    Programming language to access data stored in Oracle database.

    SQL -> control what data you want to see from database.

    SQL:
      Run queries on DB
      Modify Data
      Modify Objects (tables)

II. Database tables
  Most fundamental unit of storage

    e.g. Employee table:
          columns: id, name, salary
          rows: data matching each column

III. Overview of table data types
  * Helps maintain integrity

  3 most common types:
    1. VARCHAR2: variable length String datatype
      - VARCHAR2(100) (supports strings up to length 100)
    2. NUMBER
      - NUMBER(10) (limits integers)
      - NUMBER(3,3) (limits decimals)
    3. DATE

IV. SQL query structure

  Clauses:
    SELECT: Specify column names we want to return as part of the output of the
            query. (Required)

            Ex. SELECT id, name (only gets data from these two columns)

            Ex. SELECT * (Returns all columns from the table)

    FROM: Specify name of DB table from which we want to retrieve data. (Required)

            Ex. FROM employees (select from employees table)

    WHERE: (optional): Specify or filter which records(rows) we want to display
                       as part of the query output.

            Ex. WHERE name = 'Picard' (takes rows where names with Picard)

            Ex. WHERE name = 'Picard' or name = 'Janeway'
