I. Expression & Statements
    Expressions: combinations of literals, identifiers, operators
    - anything that returns a value is an Expressions


    Statement is a line of code, can be an expression too.

II. Whitespaces
    A block is delimited by Whitespaces
    whitespaces creates blocks of statements
    Whitespaces are meaningful in python

 III. Using print()


IV. Blocks and Scope
    Indentation levels matter!
    e.g. outer block is zero Indentation
        block under if is 4 characters.
        a half indentation cannot be matched by interpreter
    Statements must be indented at the same level

    # Indentation does not define scope of variables

V. Conditionals
    if x > y
        stmt
    elif x < y
        stmt
    else
        stmt

    Python doesn't have switch statemnent

VI. Loops
    while Loops, body of loop is executed while condition is true
    for loop iterates over sequence

VII. Functions
    In python, all functions return a value
    if no statements inside function and no return, 
    will return the default value of none

IX. Objects
