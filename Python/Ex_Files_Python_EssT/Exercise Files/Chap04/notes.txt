$ 4. Conditionals

    I. Conditional syntax
        if & elif require Conditional
        else is optional

        You can add as many elif as you want


    II. Conditional operators

        Minimally complete set of operators
        
        * Comparison Operators
            - same as Java

        * Logical operators
            and       x and y   # True if both x and y. Diff from Java -> x && y
            or        x or y    # True if x or y, Diff from Java -> x || y
            not       not x     # Invert state. Diff from Java -> !x

        * Identity Operators: test if two objects are the same object or not
            x is y      # True if the same object
            x is not y  # True if not the same object

        * Membership Operators: true if variable is a member of a collection
            x in y      # True if x member of collection y
            x not in y  # True if x not member of collection y


    III. Conditional assignment
        Since python 2.5, python has included a ternary conditional operators

        (Look at ternary-working.py)

        x = condition1 if y else condition2
        Eveything is require, must have both clauses (if and else)
