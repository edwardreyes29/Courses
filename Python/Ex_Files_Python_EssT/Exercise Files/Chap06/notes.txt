$ 6. Loops

    I. Python loops 

    II. The while loop
        while loop uses a conditional expression to control loop
        Ex.

            secret = 'swordfish'
            pw = ''

            while pw != secret:
                pw = input("What's the secret word? ")
        
        * input(prompt) # prompt is the message that ask user to enter a specific input
    
    III. The for loop 
        The for loop uses a sequence to control a loop
        
        Ex.
            animal = ( 'bear', 'bunny', 'dog', 'cat', 'velociraptor')

            for pet in animals:
                print(pet)

    IV. Additional controls
            1. Continue
                Continue clause shortcuts a loop and start it again
                as if it had reached the end of its body of code.
            2. Break
                Break clause is used to break out of a loop prematurely.
                Execution will continue after teh entire loop structure
            3. Else
                * Not common in other languages
                Else block executes only if loop ends normally.
                It will not execute if a break is used to end the loop.
                Available for both while loop and for loops

        print("Authorized" if auth else "Calling the FBI ...")
        Same as:
        if (auth):
            print("Authorized")
        else:
            print("Calling the FBI")
