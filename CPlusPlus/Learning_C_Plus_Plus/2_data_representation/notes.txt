S.2.1 Declaring simple data types
    <datatype> <variable name>;

    int myVar;
    float mySalary;
    double mySalary;
    char middleInitial = "A"; // ASCII Table values
    string firstName = "Tom";
    bool isValid = TRUE;

    int y = x * 5;

S.2.2 Declaring of Variables

    * Cannot start with special characters or numbers
    * (_) is the only special character that can be used, usually to separate characters if camel casing not used
        e.g. emp_first_name or empFirstName 
    
    int age     -> hold 4 bytes of memory allocated (4039)
    double salaryPerMonth   -> holds 8 bytes of memory allocated

    always initialize to numbers and strings, if memory is old, it may contain old data. Compiler doesn't clear out data, just renames it.

S.2.3 Storage of data in memory

    int numEggs = 3;
    numEggs = numEggs * 1.5; // decimal will be truncated

    cout << (numEggs * 1.5); // converts result into double.

    // Casting to integer
    cout << static_cast<int>(numEggs * 1.5);

    int taxRate = ceil (4.9999); // rounds up
    int taxRate = floor (4.999); // rounds down

    int remainder = 6 % 2;
    6/4 = 1 R2

    r^2 in code = pow (r, 2)
    sqrt (4.0)
    abs = int absolute values
    fabs = floating abs

    rand() // random number generattor, in C standard library
    r = rand() % 6 // generate number between 0 and 5
    add 1 to r to get a number between 1 and 6

    * Number generation start at the same point
        Seed generator to startat different point each time.
        srand() 
        srand(time(0)) // each second generates a brand new number (jan 1st, 1970)
