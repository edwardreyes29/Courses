Vim most popular editor for vim but not required


touch - updates files timestamp if it exists and if it
        doesn't exists, creates it

e.g.
    $ touch hello.sh - creates empty file named sh

To open file to edit on text editor:
    If using atom - $ atom hello.sh
    If using Visual $ Studio code - code hello.sh

echo - echo command prints to the display

To open script:
    $ bash hello.sh

bash - bash command opens script and invokes commands in it

Why do we need to type bash to execute my script.
A: Because files by default don't have the execution permission

//////////////////////////////////////
[edward@edward-pc ch_01]$ ./hello.sh
bash: ./hello.sh: Permission denied
//////////////////////////////////////

Use change mode command to make a file an executable:
$ chmod 755 hello.sh
Gives everyone permission to read and execute the script file, but only
the author the permission to write it

//////////////////////////////////////
[edward@edward-pc ch_01]$ ./hello.sh
Hello, World.
Mars is red.
//////////////////////////////////////

Now why do we need to type ./ before writing the name of the script?
//////////////////////////////////////
[edward@edward-pc ch_01]$ hello.sh
bash: hello.sh: command not found
//////////////////////////////////////

Linux systems looks for commands on the path 
and not in the current directory
If command is not in the path, Linux reports it as not found
./ tells system to not bother with the path, here's the
location of the command
