###

A. Use continue statement to step directly to Boolean Expression
    - changes flow of execution.

###
Random random = new Random();
int current = random.Next(1, 11);

do
{
    current = random.Next(1, 11);
    if (current >= 8) continue;

    Console.WriteLine(current);
} while (current != 7);

Challenge: Role playing game battle

Game Rules

    The hero and the monster will start with 10 health points.
    All attacks will be a value between 1 and 10.
    The hero will attack first.
    Print the amount of health the monster lost and their remaining health.
    If the monster's health is greater than 0, it can attack the hero.
    Print the amount of health the hero lost and their remaining health.
    Continue this sequence of attacking until either the monster's health or hero's health is zero or less.
    Print the winner.


    ###
    int hero = 10;
    int monster = 10;

    Random attack = new Random();

    do 
    {
        // Hero's turn
        int damage = attack.Next(1,11);
        monster -= damage;
        Console.WriteLine($"[Monster] Health lost: -{damage}");
        if (monster <= 0) continue;
        Console.WriteLine($"[Monster] Remaining health: {monster}\n");

        

        // Monster turn
        damage = attack.Next(1,11);
        hero -= damage;
        Console.WriteLine($"[Hero] Health lost: -{damage}");
        if (hero <= 0) continue;
        Console.WriteLine($"[Hero] Remaining health: {hero}\n");

    } while (hero > 0 && monster > 0);

    if (hero > 0) Console.WriteLine("The hero wins!");
    else Console.WriteLine("The monster wins!");

    Solution:
    ###
    int hero = 10;
    int monster = 10;

    Random dice = new Random();

    do
    {
        int roll = dice.Next(1, 10);
        monster -= roll;
        Console.WriteLine($"Monster was damaged and lost {roll} health and now has {monster} health.");

        if (monster <= 0) continue;

        roll = dice.Next(1, 10);
        hero -= roll;
        Console.WriteLine($"Hero was damaged and lost {roll} health and now has {hero} health.");

    } while (hero > 0 && monster > 0);

    Console.WriteLine(hero > monster ? "Hero wins!" : "Monster wins!");
