$ 1. Introduction to Data Structures

    I. Introduction to data and data types

        Data: information that is stored or processed by a computer

        Data point examples: Birthday, city, location, initials, etc....

        Commmon Types of data:
            - Numbers
            - Letters
            - True (1)
            - False (0)
        
        Data Type: attr of data that describes the values it can 
            have and how data can be used

    II. Numerical data types

        How much space each data type takes up & what values they can hold
        Whole Numbers:
            Short:  16 bits
            Int:    32 bits
            Long:   64 bits
        Decimal Numbers:
            Float:  32 bits // 7 decimal digits
            Double: 64 bits // 16 decimal digits    

        Signed and Unsigned numerical data types:
            - affects specific range of values.
            
            Signed:
                * Positive and negative values

            Unsigned:
                  * Only positive values
                  * Doubles the positive value range  
        
        JavaScript: numbers
        Java: short, int, long, float, double
        Python 2: int, long, float, complex
        Python 3: long(int)
            - used for scientific and mathematical computations
        
        Java:
            float myNum = 10.0f;
        JavaScript:
            var myNum = 29
        Swift:
            var myNum:Double = 10.24

    III. Booleans and characters

        // C#
        bool isLightOn = false;

        # Python
        isLightOn = True

        'K' 'a' 't' 'i' 'e'

    IV. Primitive types in memory
        Boolean is represented by a 1 bit or a 0 bit -> one bit

        int is 32 bits
         00000000000000000000000000001111 = 15
        - int 
        - doubles 
        - longs 
        - floats
        - etc...

    V. Introduction to data Structures
        "Data structures are containers, they allow us to store several pieces 
         of data into a single structures"

        Represents the number of pets each student has
        Number of Pets = {0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 4, 3, 0, 1, 0}    

        Data structures give us organizations, storage, and access

    
    VI. Strings
        - Sequence of characters
        - It's a data structure itself
        - Not a primitive
            - Amount of memory depends on
                * Allocated space for structure
                * Number of pieces of data
                * Size of each data pieces

        // JavaScript
        var name = "Jessica"

        # Python
        name = 'Jessica'
        


    VII. Primitive vs. reference types in memory
        Data structures not stored consecutively in memmory, otherwise 
        they would risk losing data if one collection overlaps the otherwise

        Data structures use pointers to point to their location in memory

        C++ (manage pointers, memory, and data)
        Java & Python (memory management handled for you)
