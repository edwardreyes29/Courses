Benefits of Hash Tables:
    Suppose we had a list of items and we wanted to reduce this list ot items to eliminate duplicates.
    A hash table provides a simple way of doing this
    Loop over each of the items in the list, and add them to the hash table as a key with whatever value we wanted
    If key already exists, it will be replaced
