    Universal Resource Locator: Human-readable address describing where on teh web a particular resource is located.

    Two parts:
        1. Protocol declaration: https://
        2. URN: Uniform Resource Name: edwardtreyes.com/
            - host/connection-port/resource-path/URL-query

        connection port: usually hidden | https default :443 | http default :80
        resource-path:
            - index.html
            - default.htm

            If anything else, needs to list file path specifically
            - mysite.com/folder/about.html
            - mysite.com/folder/contact.html

        URL-query:
            - ?u=1234567
            - optional
                - can perform further actions, like tracking user id or filter contents.
